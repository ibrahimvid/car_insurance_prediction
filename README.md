# Car Insurance Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether customers will purchase car insurance based on demographic, vehicle, and contact features. The repository includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result generation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate classification models that predict whether a customer will buy car insurance. We perform:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and tuning multiple classification algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Dataset

The dataset consists of sales records with customer demographics, vehicle information, and campaign contact details.

Files:
- `data/Train_data.csv`: Training set with target variable `car_insurance`.
- `data/Test_data.csv`: Test set without the target.
- `Sample_Submission.csv`: Example submission format.
- `prediction_results.csv`: Predictions generated by the best model.

Features include:
- `age`, `gender`, `driving_license`, `region_code`, `previously_insured`
- `vehicle_age`, `vehicle_damage`, `annual_premium`, `policy_sales_channel`, `vintage`
- Contact features: `communication`, `last_contact_day`, `last_contact_month`, `no_of_contacts`, `days_passed`, `prev_attempts`, `outcome`, `call_start`, `call_end`
- Target: `car_insurance` (0 = not purchased, 1 = purchased)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost jupyterlab
   ```

## Usage

### Running Locally
1. Ensure `Train_data.csv` and `Test_data.csv` are in the `data/` directory.
2. Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
3. Open and run the `Car_Insurance.ipynb` notebook step by step.

### Running on Google Colab
1. Open `car-insurance-prediction-leader-notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload the `Train_data.csv` and `Test_data.csv` files when prompted.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis end-to-end.

## Notebooks

- **Car_Insurance.ipynb**: Data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, modeling with multiple classifiers (`LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `XGBClassifier`, etc.), hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- **car-insurance-prediction-leader-notebook.ipynb**: Detailed exploratory workflow and baseline modeling showing performance metrics.

## Results

- Model predictions on the test set are saved in `prediction_results.csv`.
- Compare results with `Sample_Submission.csv` for submission formatting.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
